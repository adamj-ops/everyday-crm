### ‚úÖ **API Routes Updated**
- All API routes now use real Clerk authentication
- Created `getCurrentAuth()` helper function
- Fallback to dev constants in development mode
- Proper organization-based multi-tenancy

### ‚úÖ **Authentication Flow**
- Users must be signed in to access `/deals` and API routes
- Users must be in an organization to access protected resources

## üö® **REQUIRED: Add Environment Variables to Vercel**

Your deployment failed because Clerk environment variables are missing. You need to add these to Vercel:

### **Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard**
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/opsfx/everyday-crm
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Environment Variables** in sidebar

### **Step 2: Add These Variables**

From your `.env.local` file, add these to Vercel:

```
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
```

**Plus your existing variables:**
```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgres_url
DEV_USER_ID=aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa
DEV_ORG_ID=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
BILLING_PLAN_ENV=prod
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
```

### **Step 3: Redeploy**
After adding the environment variables:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment

## üéØ **How Authentication Now Works**

### **Protected Routes**
- `/deals` - Requires authentication + organization
- `/dashboard` - Requires authentication + organization
- All `/api/deals/*`, `/api/offers/*`, `/api/documents/*` - Requires authentication

### **Authentication Flow**
1. User visits `/deals` ‚Üí Redirected to sign-in if not authenticated
2. User signs in ‚Üí If no organization, redirected to organization selection
3. User selects organization ‚Üí Can access deals and API routes
4. API routes use `getCurrentAuth()` to get user/org from Clerk

### **Multi-tenancy**
- Each API call gets the user's current organization from Clerk
- Database queries are filtered by `org_id` automatically
- Users can only see/modify data for their organization

## üß™ **Testing After Deployment**

Once you've added the environment variables and redeployed:

1. **Visit the app**: https://everyday-9gavpoxun-opsfx.vercel.app
2. **Try to access deals**: Should redirect to sign-in
3. **Sign in with Clerk**: Should work with your existing Clerk setup
4. **Access deals page**: Should show deals for your organization

## üîß **Development vs Production**

- **Development**: Falls back to dev constants if no Clerk auth (for testing)
- **Production**: Requires real Clerk authentication
- **Database**: Uses your Neon PostgreSQL in both environments

## ‚úÖ **Ready for Multi-Device Access**

Once environment variables are added:
- **Production URL**: https://everyday-9gavpoxun-opsfx.vercel.app
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/adamj-ops/everyday-crm
- **Full Clerk authentication**: Sign in from any device
- **Organization-based access**: Secure multi-tenant CRM

Your CRM is now properly secured with Clerk authentication! üîê
