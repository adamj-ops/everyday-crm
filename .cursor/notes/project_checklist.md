# Project Checklist - Vercel Blob Document Upload

## Current Task: Implement Document Upload API with Vercel Blob

### Implementation Steps
- [x] Set up project documentation structure
- [x] Create documents table schema in Drizzle
- [x] Implement database migration for documents table
- [x] Create RLS helper functions for multi-tenant security
- [x] Install Vercel Blob package dependency
- [x] Create API route `/src/app/api/documents/upload/route.ts`
- [x] Implement blob upload with both blob_url and blob_path persistence
- [x] Create test scripts for verification
- [x] Test the implementation with database queries
- [x] Verify database records are created correctly
- [x] Confirm both blob_url and blob_path persistence
- [x] Validate multi-tenant isolation and deal association

### Technical Requirements
- Store both `blob_url` (for direct access) and `blob_path` (for logical grouping)
- Support multi-tenant architecture with organization-based isolation
- Handle file metadata (mime_type, file_size, title)
- Associate documents with deals via `deal_id`
- Use authenticated access for blob storage

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] File upload functionality works
- [ ] Database record is created with correct fields
- [ ] Both blob_url and blob_path are stored
- [ ] Organization isolation is enforced
- [ ] Error handling for missing parameters
- [ ] File metadata is captured correctly
